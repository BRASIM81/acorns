                    p Alderton Acorns Pre-School Group is open to children from 2 years 6 months up to 5 years. Children join us to have fun and to learn, through play, the individual skills needed to enter school confidently and enthusiastically. Sessions run from 9am to 1pm Monday to Thursday during term time.
                    p â€‹Children usually start with two sessions per week and build up to more when they are ready.  For children in their pre-school year we include special study groups where they can concentrate on more structured play and pre-reading/writing skills.
